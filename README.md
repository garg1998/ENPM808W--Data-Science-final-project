# Linkedin Data Analysis
In the ever-evolving landscape of today's job market, staying ahead of employment
trends is not just beneficial, but essential for both job seekers and employers. Our
initiative, titled "LinkedIn Job Analysis," is rooted in this very understanding. We
embarked on a mission to harness the wealth of data from LinkedIn Job Postings,
aiming to extract and distill comprehensive insights into the currents shaping the job
market today.

As International Students who have personally navigated the daunting task of applying
to hundreds of jobs, we recognize the profound importance of understanding job market
trends and the level of competition within it. This insight is particularly crucial for
students like us, who must continually adapt to the fluctuating dynamics of the job
market. Our project, therefore, is more than an academic exercise; it's a practical
solution crafted from our own experiences and needs.

Through our analysis, we aimed to go beyond mere observation, providing predictive
insights on the number of applicants for future job postings. This aspect of our project is
designed to empower job seekers with foresight, enabling them to anticipate
competition and prepare accordingly. Similarly, for employers, these insights offer a
window into the demand dynamics of various roles, assisting them in understanding
how to attract the right talent.
